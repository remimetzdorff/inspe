abstract = {An understanding of the concepts of atom and molecule is fundamental to the learning of chemistry. Any misconceptions and alternative conceptions that students harbor about these concepts will impede further learning. This article identifies misconceptions related to the fundamental characteristics of atoms and molecules which Grade‐12 students hold. Data were obtained by administration of semistructured interviews to a stratified, random sample of 30 students of differing abilities and backgrounds in science. Fifty‐two misconceptions were observed and are reported. These are grouped into 11 categories. Six relate to the structure, composition, size, shape, weight, bonding, and energy of molecules; five relate to the structure, shape, size, weight, and animistic perceptions of atoms. Some of the misconceptions identified parallel the historical development of scientific concepts. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract = {The concept of atom is one of the concepts that have neither examples nor noticeable attributes, his epistemology involves a proliferation of models and their use in science education extends from the figurative representation in linking concepts a high degree of abstraction. The study described from a questionnaire given to 25 future teachers of secondary education in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, has shown that they have many gaps in learning, which are regularly compounded by negative attitudes conveyed face to "know" atom. We also noted the existence of a historical and epistemological knowledge gap on the atom concept and noted that the approach used for this education is strongly linked to the representations of teachers and material constraints under which this education takes place. Thus, neither their way through higher education or in vocational training at the " Ecole Normale Sup{\'{e}}rieure d'Abidjan " could cause a conceptual change in these future teachers.},
