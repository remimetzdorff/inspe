@article{Rayleigh1890,
abstract = {NUMEROUS and varied phenomena prove that the tension of a water surface is lowered by the presence of even a trace of grease. In the case of olive-oil, a film whose calculated thickness is as low as 2 micro-millimetres is sufficient to entirely alter the properties of the surface in relation to fragments of camphor floating thereupon. It seemed to me of importance for the theory of capillarity to ascertain with some approach to precision the tensions of greasy surfaces; and in a recent paper I gave some results applicable to the comparison of a clean surface with one just greasy enough to stop. the camphor movements and also with one saturated with olive-oil. The method employed was that depending upon the rise of liquid between parallel plates of glass ; and I was not satisfied with it, not merely on account of the roughness of the measurement, but also because the interpretation of the result depends upon the assumption that the angle of contact with the glass is zero. In the opinion of Prof. Quineke, whose widely extended researches in this field give great weight to his authority, this assumption is incorrect even in the case of pure liquids, and, as it seemed to me, is still less to be trusted in its application to contaminated surfaces, the behaviour of which is still in many respects obscure. I was thus desirous of checking my results by a method independent of the presence of a solid body.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {Benjamin Franklin, mostly known for his participation in writing The Declaration of Independence and work on electricity, was also one of the first scientists to seek to understand the properties of oil monolayers on water surfaces. During one of his many voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, Franklin observed that oil had a calming effect on waves when poured into rough ocean waters. Though at first taking a backseat to many of his other scientific and political endeavors, Franklin went on to experiment with oil, spreading monomolecular films on various bodies of water, and ultimately devised a concept of particle repulsion that is indirectly related to the hydrophobic effect. His early observations inspired others to measure the dimensions of oil monolayers, which eventually led to the formulation of the contemporary lipid bilayer model of the cell membrane. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},
